## 1. Stellar Mass-Dispersion Measure Correlations Constrain Baryonic Feedback in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies
- **Number**: 0
- **Abstract**: Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the
host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain
the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby
FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar
masses ranging from $10^9 < M^* / M_\odot < 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution
of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a
mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its
host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$
pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar
fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations
from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM
contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile
the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid
model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between
stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m > 0$) to the CGM are in tension
with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of
assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the
statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline.
Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback
in the Local Universe $(z < 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing
results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo
mass and redshift ranges.

## 2. Mixture-of-Expert Variational Autoencoders for Cross-Modality Embedding of Type Ia Supernova Data
- **Number**: 1
- **Abstract**: Time-domain astrophysics relies on heterogeneous and multi-modal data.
Specialized models are often constructed to extract information from a single
modality, but this approach ignores the wealth of cross-modality information
that may be relevant for the tasks to which the model is applied. In this work,
we propose a multi-modal, mixture-of-expert variational autoencoder to learn a
joint embedding for supernova light curves and spectra. Our method, which is
inspired by the Perceiver architecture, natively accommodates variable-length
inputs and the irregular temporal sampling inherent to supernova light curves.
We train our model on radiative transfer simulations and validate its
performance on cross-modality reconstruction of supernova spectra and physical
parameters from the simulation. Our model achieves superior performance in
cross-modality generation to nearest-neighbor searches in a
contrastively-trained latent space, showing its promise for constructing
informative latent representations of multi-modal astronomical datasets.
