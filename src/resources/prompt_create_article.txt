Introduction to SST-1Ms
Observationsofveryhighenergy(VHE)gammarayscanshedlightonthehighlyaccelerating
processesintheuniverse. However,VHEgammarayscannotbedirectlydetectedbyground-based
telescopes, as they are absorbed in the atmosphere. Instead, they can be detected by ground-
based telescopes through Cherenkov radiation produced by charged particles resulting from the
interactions of gamma-ray photons with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere.

Ond≈ôejov site shows the two SST-1Ms located 155.2 m apart (C. Alispach et al., 2025).

(see right panel of Figure 1) [1, 2]. The SST-1M timestamps are synchronized to nanosecond
precision using the White Rabbit timing network [3]. SST-1M was designed by a consortium
of institutes from Poland, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic, aiming for the detection of the
VHE gamma-rays induced atmospheric showers in the energy range of 3-300 TeV. SST-1M uses a
4-m diameter, single multi-segmented mirror dish composed of 18 hexagonal facets and a highly
performing SiPM-based camera with a wide optical field of view of 9 degrees. These SST-1Ms
are designed and built to enable remote observations and can be used in mono and stereo modes.
The geometrical and timing properties of the detected waveforms are used to find the physical
propertiesof theprimaryparticle. Theraw pixelwaveformsare calibratedandprocessed uptothe
photon list with reconstructed energies and arrival directions (see [2] for the details of the analysis
and reconstruction) using the standard data processing and analysis tool developed for SST-1M,

1. Markarian 421
Blazars are a particular class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN), characterized by the
ultra-relativisticjetsfromthesupermassiveblackholebeingorientedalongorveryclosetotheline
of sight. Due to relativistic beaming, the jet pointing toward us appears highly boosted and often
dominates the observed emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, while the counter-jet

istypicallyundetectable. BlazarsarethemostcommonlydetectedclassofVHEgamma-raysources
in the extragalactic sky. Their spectral energy distribution (SED) is characterized by two energy
peaks. Thelow-energypeakisproducedbythesynchrotronemissionfromultra-relativisticelectrons
embedded in the magnetic field of the jet, while the high-energy peak is thought to be produced
by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission [5]. Based on the position of the synchrotron peak,
these sources are subclassified as low synchrotron peaked (LSP) blazars if the peak frequency is
lessthan1014Hz,orhighsynchrotronpeaked(HSP)blazarsifthefrequencyislargerthan1014Hz.
Mrk 421 is an HSP blazar and a strong gamma-ray source. It is the closest and one of the
brightestblazars,ataredshift ùëß=0.031oradistanceof122MpcfromtheEarth. Itwasfirstdetected
above 0.5 TeV by the Whipple Observatory in 1992 [6]. This source is continuously monitored by
theLargeAreaTelescope(LAT)onboardNASA‚ÄôsFermiGamma-RaySpaceTelescopeintheenergy
range of 50 MeV to 1 TeV. Recently, the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory
reported photons with energies up to 9 TeV [5]. It is a highly variable source; hence, several
multi-wavelength studies have been performed by many telescopes over the years.

3. Data Modeling
Previous studies [e.g. 5] show a good fit for the low and high-energy components, but a poor
fit for the high-energy tail, usually due to a lack of sufficient data. In this study, we aim to obtain
better fits of the high-energy tail of Mrk 421 with the addition of new data observed by SST-1M at
photon energies greater than 2 TeV.
Following [5], we use the Python package agnpy[10], and a ùúí2fit is then performed by
the Python package gammapy. We consider a broken power law for the distribution of relativistic

# üåå Unveiling The Secrets Of Blazing Cosmic Behemoths: How The SST-1M Telescope Is Sherpherding Our Understanding Of Markarian 421

Subtitle: Cutting-edge observations shed light on one of the universe's most energetic and enigmatic objects

---

### üî≠ What Is So Special About Mrk 421?

Imagine a lighthouse, but instead of shining on a coast, it beams intensely into the depths of space ‚Äî that‚Äôs what blazars like Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) are for the universe. These galaxies host supermassive black holes that launch jets of particles moving close to the speed of light directly toward Earth, dramatically boosting their emissions. This makes them like cosmic fireworks, radiating across the electromagnetic spectrum, especially in gamma rays‚Äîthe universe‚Äôs most energetic light.

Mrk 421 is notably one of the closest and brightest of these high-frequency peaked blazars. Sitting at a cosmic distance of about 122 million parsecs, it‚Äôs been a favorite target for astronomers seeking to understand how black holes power jets and accelerate particles to universe-defying energies.

---

### üõ∞Ô∏è How Did The New Observations Happen?

Detecting gamma rays from Earth is tricky‚Äîthese high-energy photons are absorbed by our atmosphere. So, astronomers use a clever trick called the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique, which involves detecting faint flashes of blue Cherenkov light produced when gamma rays interact with Earth's atmosphere, creating showers of secondary particles.

This is where the SST-1M (Small-Size Telescopes) comes into play. Located at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, these telescopes are compact but mighty, using sophisticated cameras and synchronization systems to catch these fleeting Cherenkov flashes. During early 2024, the team used two such telescopes to observe Mrk 421 for over 50 hours in total, meticulously filtering the data to ensure only the clearest signals were studied.

---

### üîç What Did The Data Reveal?

After rigorous analysis, the team confirmed that Mrk 421 was actively emitting gamma rays, with a solid detection significance ‚Äî meaning the signals are real and not just background noise. Their measurements showed the energy spectrum of the gamma rays well fits typical models, with the source exhibiting variability in its emission but without any dramatic flare-ups during this period.

By building a spectral energy distribution (SED)‚Äîa chart showing how much energy the source emits at different frequencies‚Äîthe researchers could fit models that describe the physical processes inside the jet. Specifically, they used a Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model, which suggests that most of the high-energy emission results from electrons accelerating and scattering their own emitted light up to gamma-ray energies.

The modeling yielded parameters consistent with previous studies but with improved precision, such as the strength of magnetic fields in the jet and the energies that the particles reach. These details are vital to understanding how jets are powered and how particles are accelerated to nearly the speed of light.

---

### üåå Why Does This Matter?

Each new observation of blazars like Mrk 421 is like adding a piece to a cosmic jigsaw puzzle. Understanding their high-energy behavior helps astronomers learn about extreme physics‚Äîmagnetism, relativistic jets, and particle acceleration‚Äîthat can‚Äôt be replicated on Earth. Furthermore, these insights help us understand the environments around supermassive black holes and the role they play in galaxy evolution.

By improving observational techniques and models, we can also better interpret transient phenomena, such as flares, which might encode clues about the most energetic processes in the universe. Since Mrk 421 is relatively close, it serves as a nearby laboratory for these cosmic extremes.

---

### ü§î What‚Äôs Next?

The early results from SST-1M are promising, but they‚Äôre just the beginning. Future work will incorporate data from other observatories like HAWC and multiple wavelengths to refine the models of Mrk 421‚Äôs emissions further. Continuous monitoring can also catch sudden flares, providing real-time insights into jet dynamics and particle acceleration.

The ongoing development of smaller, more sensitive telescopes like SST-1M promises to open new windows into the high-energy universe, revealing secrets that remain hidden in these cosmic powerhouses. As technology advances and collaborations grow, the mysteries of blazars like Mrk 421 may soon unlock answers to some of astronomy‚Äôs most profound questions about extreme physics and the universe‚Äôs most energetic phenomena.

Abstract
The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of dista nt quasars by in-
tervening galaxies: image splittings, relative ampliÔ¨Åcations, time delay s, and optical
depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the grav itational constant G
at cosmological distances. These allow one, in principle, to factor ou t unknown
lensing parameters to directly to probe the variation of Gover cosmological time.
We estimate constraints on ÀôGwhich may be derivable by this method both now
and in the future. The limits one may obtain can compete or exceed ot her direct
limits on ÀôGtoday, but unfortunately extracting this information, is not indep endent
of the eÔ¨Äort to Ô¨Åx other cosmological parameters such as H0and ‚Ñ¶ 0from lensing
observations.

11. Introduction
The gravitational constant, G, is the poorest measured fundamental con-
stant in nature. In fact, it may not even be a constant at all. The ex ceedingly
small value of G, coupled with the large value of the age of the universe encour-
aged speculation early on, Ô¨Årst following Dirac and then spurred by t he advent
of Brans-Dicke cosmology, that the two quantities may be somehow tied together
[Dirac 1937, Dyson]. Moreover, because classical general relativit y cannot be quan-
tized, there has been a recurring interest in the possibility that GR a rises as the
low energy limit of a more fundamental theory. In such a theory, th e gravitational
constant may arise dynamically, associated with the vacuum expect ation value of
some Ô¨Åeld (or dynamics of some internal space). Since this dynamica l value may be
time dependent, so may G. Over the past year, largely as a result of considerations
based on extensions of the original old inÔ¨Çationary models [Guth 1981 , Linde 1982,
Albrecht and Steinhardt 1982, Steinhardt and Accetta 1990], the re has been a re-
newed interest [La and Steinhardt 1989] in the possibility that the gr avitational
constant has varied on cosmological timescales.
There exist several sensitive direct probes of a monotonic change in the grav-
itational constant during the present epoch, including the use of p ulsar timing mea-
surements and radar experiments, all of which suggest that ÀôG/GH‚â§0.4 today.
[Shapiro 1964, Shapiro et al. 1971, Helling 1987, Reasen 1983, Damou r et al. 1988]
At the opposite extreme, calculations of primordial nucleosynthes is put indirect
limits on ÀôGduring the Ô¨Årst seconds of the big bang expansion from limits on the
observed Helium abundance [Accetta et al. 1990]. If the variation of Ghas followed
a constant power law in time, the latter limit ( ÀôG/GH‚â§0.01) is stronger than the
2direct limits on the variation today . What has been lacking however is a ny way to
directly probe the value of Gat times between these two epochs. Since it has even
been proposed that Gmay oscillate in time [Accetta and Steinhardt 1991], a direct
measure of Gat intermediate times would be of great interest. It is the purpose
of this paper to suggest that observations of gravitational lensin g could, in princi-
ple, provide such a measure, and to investigate the realistic limits whic h it may be
possible to obtain.
On Ô¨Årst thought it is not clear that lensing can constrain G. While the
bend angle which light rays are subject to is directly related to the st rength of the
gravitational constant at the time light rays pass the lensing objec t, the quantity
which enters into all formulas is the product GM, whereMis the mass of the
lensing object. Unless Mcan be determined independently a separate extraction
ofGseems impossible. However, it is not the actual bend angle which is dire ctly
observed in gravitational lensing. All lensing observables depend als o (in somewhat
diÔ¨Äerent ways) upon the distance of the lensing galaxy and the quas ar as inferred
from their redshifts. The distance redshift relation depends upon the time-averaged
value ofG, which for redshifts of O(1) can be a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of the lifetime
of the universe. Thus for any lensing system a prediction of one obs ervable based
on a measurement of another can give a signal of the time variability o fG. What
remains to be seen however is exactly how sensitive such a compariso n is, and how
much it depends on our knowledge, or lack thereof, of cosmological parameters such
as the Hubble constant H0, the density parameter ‚Ñ¶ 0, and even the cosmological
constant Œõ.
The organization of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we outline our n ota-
3tions and conventions and introduce the models we will use. In sectio n 3 we consider
constraints from lensing statistics and in section 4 we discuss const raints which can
be derived from individual lensing systems. Section 5 contains our co nclusions.
2. Cosmology and Lens Models
The observables of interest in gravitational lensing depend upon th e combi-
nation GM (where M is the mass of the lensing galaxy) and the distance to the
galaxy and source. If it is assumed that the bending occurs predom inantly as the
light rays pass through the local region of the lensing galaxy and thu s the time
required is much shorter than the time scale over which G varies signiÔ¨Å cantly, the
eÔ¨Äect of the variation of G will be to replace GM by GlM(whereGlis G at the time
of lensing) and also to alter the distance-red shift relation. Measur ing the Ô¨Årst eÔ¨Äect
is cleanest, in principle, because it is not dependent upon cosmologica l modelling.
Unfortunately, unless there is an independent way to determine th e mass of the
lensing galaxy the Ô¨Årst eÔ¨Äect alone is unmeasurable. Since both veloc ity dispersion,
and stellar luminosity will also depend upon G, there are no observables which seem
to allowMto be independently extracted.
Hence, to proceed, we must consider some speciÔ¨Åc cosmological mo del, incor-
porating a variable G. We will consider for deÔ¨Åniteness a Brans-Dicke (BD) theory
(thisisperhapsthesimplest viableextensionofGRwithavaryinggrav itationalcon-
stant and is often used in connection with extended inÔ¨Çationary mod els). While our
discussionwillbeintermsofBDcosmology,thegeneralfeaturessh ouldbecharacter-
istic of any model with varying G. In particular, these ideas could be applied to any
theory based on the Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric (which ha s gained more ex-
4perimental support recently from the isotropy of the cosmic micro wave background)
with an evolution equation for the scale factor determined by the eq uation of state
of matter which also incorporates a varying value of Gconsistently in the equations
of motion (e.g. [Dyson, Beckenstein 1977, Beckenstein and Meisels 1 980]).
In the BD cosmology the line element is the usual FRW metric
ds2=‚àídt2+R2(t)[dœá2+sk(œá)2d‚Ñ¶] (1)
wheresk= sinh(œá),œá,sin(œá) fork=‚àí1,0,1. Einstein‚Äôs equations are modiÔ¨Åed and
a new dynamical Ô¨Åeld œÜ, withG‚àºœÜ‚àí1, is introduced. For large time the general so-
lutionoftheBrans-DickeÔ¨Åeldequationswillbematterdominatedand inmanycases
ofinterest(e.g. [Weinberg 1972,La and Steinhardt 1989,Steinhar dt and Accetta 1990])
œÜ‚àºRœÉ, where œÉwill be a function of the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor coupling
constant3,œâ, which tends to zero in the limit œâ‚Üí ‚àû(where Einstein‚Äôs theory
is recovered).
|3The independent limits on the scalar-tensor coupling constant in the simplest
Brans-Dicke theory are already far more stringent than we will plac e from the vari-
ation ofG[Reasonberg 1979], but our purpose here is to use this model merely as
a testing ground to explore the sensitivity of lensing parameters to G.|

scale factor in a matter dominated epoch is

Note that if one instead were simply to allow Gto vary as a power law and
were to use Einstein‚Äôs equations unchanged one would obtain the sam e result (4,5),
except without the last factor on the r.h.s. of (5). For a Ô¨Åxed value of ‚Ñ¶0andH0,
it is this factor which causes R0to vary with œâ.
The measure of distance we will use is the angular diameter distance
dA=R0
1+zsk(œá) (6)
whichassumesthatthelensedraystraverseameanÔ¨Ålled‚Äúbeam‚Äù. ( Similar, butalge-
braically more complex constraints can be obtained in the case of an ‚Äú empty‚Äù beam
approximation, whereaÔ¨Éneanglesanddistancesareused(i.e. see[T urner et al. 1984,
Krauss and White 1991]). The mean Ô¨Ålled beam approximation is probab ly closer
to the actual situation, however, it has been shown that the unce rtainty due to
clumpiness of matter in the beam trajectory can be one of the main s ources of un-
certainty in the analysis of individual lensing systems [Alcock and Ande rson 1985].
If the Hubble constant were independently measured it is possible th at this uncer-
tainty could be reduced since it also enters into the determinations o fH0from time
delays in lensing systems.
Once the evolution equation for the scale factor, R(t), is speciÔ¨Åed we can
solve for the distance redshift relation in the usual way [Weinberg 19 72]. For the
special case k= 0 we obtain a simple expression for the distance as a function of
6x= 1+z, (similar expressions for ‚Ñ¶ 0/negationslash= 1 can also be obtained.)
dA=1

whereŒ≤= (1 +œÉ)/2. The distance is plotted in Ô¨Ågure 1 for Œ≤= 0.4,0.5,0.6,
and reduces to the usual expression [Turner et al. 1984] in the limit o f constant G
(œâ‚Üí ‚àû,Œ≤‚Üí1/2). As a guide to the expected magnitude of Œ≤one would like to
obtain sensitivity to, notice that an assumed variation-since-lensin g of

for lenses zl‚àº1.5. This corresponds to Œ≤‚àº0.6. If we take the age of the universe
to bet0= 2/(3+œÉ)H‚àí1
0= 1010yr, this then gives
ÀôG/G|0=‚àíœÉH0‚àº10‚àí11yr‚àí1(9)
which is comparable with other direct measures of ÀôG/G.
We will consider two simpliÔ¨Åed lens models in what follows: the point mass
andtheisothermal sphere lenses. The point masslens is chosen for its simplicity, the
isothermal lens because the Ô¨Çatness of rotation curves of galaxie s suggest œÅ‚àºr‚àí2is
a reasonable approximation to galactic mass distributions (at least a symptotically).
While for any actual lens system these models are overly simplistic the y serve to
illustrate the main points. The observables for these lens systems w hich we would
want toexamineforsensitivity to Œ≤are: timedelaysbetween images, anglesbetween
images and ratio in brightness of the images, as well as the (diÔ¨Äerent ial and total)
optical depth for lensing.
73. Lensing statistics
The formalism appropriate to gravitational lensing statistics was Ô¨År st devel-
oped in [Turner et al. 1984] and latter generalized to arbitrary Robe rtson-Walker
cosmologies in [Gott et al. 1989] (see also [Krauss and White 1991] for a recent pre-
sentation). The key quantity is the optical depth, or integrated p robability of
lensing,œÑ, assuming a non-evolving population of galaxies, modelled as singular
isothermal spheres. This depth is relatively free of matter cluster ing uncertainties
[Alcock and Anderson 1985] but is sensitive to variations in the distan ce-redshift
relation, which makes it a good probe of cosmology.
As an example consider the expression for œÑ, for ak= 0 universe. Including
theŒ≤dependence of the bend angle ( Œ±‚àºG) we obtain
œÑ(y= 1+z) =F

;F=n0œÄŒ±2

0(10)
whereH0R0= 1 and n0is the comoving number density of galactic lenses, which
we assume in this instance are all identical (non-evolving) isotherma l spheres pro-
ducing identical bend angles Œ±0. The bend angle Œ±0is related to measured velocity
dispersions of nearby galaxies today. For further details of these deÔ¨Ånitions see
[Turner et al. 1984]. Equation (10) reduces to eqn (2.26c) of [Turne r et al. 1984] in
the limit Œ≤‚Üí1/2. The integral can be done analytically but the result is cumber-
some and is not shown here. The optical depth vs redshift is shown in Ô¨Ågure 2 for
Œ≤= 0.4,0.5,0.6. As can be seen the variation with Œ≤is slight making this a poor
measure of ÀôG/G. A similarly small dependence on Œ≤is shown by the diÔ¨Äerential
optical depth dœÑ/dz. Since the distance-redshift relation becomes less Œ≤dependent
as ‚Ñ¶0decreases we expect the variation in œÑto be less than above when ‚Ñ¶ 0<1, al-
8though this is somewhat oÔ¨Äset by the Œ≤dependence of Fcoming through R0. Thus
variations of Ggoing as a power law in time have little eÔ¨Äect on lensing statistics, at
least at the level where these statistics are likely to be determined in the forseeable
future.
4. Individual systems
A better hope of constraining ÀôGcomes from examining the observables asso-
ciated with multiply imaged quasars (i.e. see[Hewitt et al. 1988]). SpeciÔ¨Å cally we
will be interested in the observables: time delay, image splitting and ima ge magniÔ¨Å-
cation for our two model lenses. The strategy will be the following: e ach observable
will depend both on GM, and on dA(G). If we have more than two observables
for each system, then we hope to overly constrain the system so t hat we can check
for consistency between the diÔ¨Äerent determinations of these qu antities from each
observable.
1) Point mass lens.
For these lenses the time delay ‚àÜ tand ratio in magnitude of images rare
related through [Krauss and Small 1991]
‚àÜt= 2GM(1+z)[(r‚àí1‚àör)+log(r)] (11)
(the (1+ z) factor is absent in microlensing [Krauss and Small 1991]) so these tw o
parameters can be used to infer GMat the time of lensing, independently of the
cosmological distance-redshift relation . If it is not possible to measure ‚àÜ tin the lens
system, or if the measure has a large uncertainty, GMmust be obtained some other
way, e.g. from virial velocity measurements. Any limit on Œ≤will depend on how
9well this quantity is known.
GivenGMwe can use the observed angular splitting of images and the
relation
‚àÜŒ∏=4GM
c2Sr‚àí1/radicalBig
r1/2(r‚àí1)‚àí2r(12)
to determine S=DS/DLSwhereDSandDLSare the angular diameter distances
from the observer to the source and from the lens to the source r espectively. This
is a function only of the (known) redshifts, ‚Ñ¶ 0andŒ≤, e.g. in the k= 0 case
S‚â°s0(œáS)
s0(œáS‚àíœáL)=1‚àíx‚àíŒ≤
S
x‚àíŒ≤
L‚àíx‚àíŒ≤
S(13)
so a knowledge of the redshifts allows a determination of Œ≤(up to clumping un-
certainties [Alcock and Anderson 1985]) if we assume a value for ‚Ñ¶ 0(or conversely
a determination of ‚Ñ¶ 0if we know Œ≤). Notice that S is a ratio of distances and so
is independent of H0. As an example if we take zL= 1,zS= 3 then for k= 0,
mean Ô¨Ålled beam, S is a monotonically increasing function of Œ≤varying from 2 .3 to
2.5 asŒ≤runs from 0 .4 to 0.6 as can be seen in Ô¨Ågure 3. Given the above and the
fact that typical image splittings can be ‚àº3‚Ä≤‚Ä≤‚àí7‚Ä≤‚Ä≤it is not impossible that a good
measurement of the angular splitting could limit Œ≤to be in the range competitive
with other direct probes of ÀôG.
2) Isothermal Sphere
For the somewhat more realistic, isothermal sphere model the situ ation is
simpler (in principle). If the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, œÉ||, is known,
say from measurements of the rotation curves, a measure of the angular splitting
10allows us to immediately infer S:
‚àÜŒ∏=2Œ±
c2S=8œÄœÉ2
||
c2S‚áíS=8œÄ
‚àÜŒ∏/parenleftbiggœÉ||
c/parenrightbigg2
(14)
In fact a simultaneous measurement of the time delay, which gives us D=DL/S
(whereDLis the angular diameter distance from the observer to the lens),
‚àÜt= 32œÄ2(1+z)/parenleftbiggœÉ||
c/parenrightbigg4D
c(15)
and the image splitting would in principle allow us to measure both Œ≤and ‚Ñ¶ 0(up
to uncertainties in H0, because DLhas the dimensions of distance and hence is de-
pendent upon H0) because the dependence of DandSonŒ≤and ‚Ñ¶ 0is diÔ¨Äerent4.
We expect the strongest constraint on Œ≤for Ô¨Åxed ‚Ñ¶ 0to come from Showever.
|4See Ô¨Ågure 4. |
The singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model is probably still too naiv e to
apply to actual individual lens systems. One should at least include th e eÔ¨Äects of
a Ô¨Ånite galactic core [Hinshaw and Krauss 1987, Krauss and White 199 1]. Alterna-
tively, a more complicated, but more general model, the ‚Äòelliptical lens ‚Äô
[Narayan and Grossman 1988], is available for use in extracting these quantities for
individual galactic lenses. Nevertheless, the SIS model should give a general idea
of the methodology to be used, and the possible sensitivity to Œ≤. Using these other
models in an application of these ideas to actual lenses would merely re quire replac-
ing the above equations for Sand ‚àÜtwith somewhat more complicated equations
which would include the lensing parameters Ô¨Åt by the observations.
Because of the simplicity of the SIS model we only had to make due with 2
lensing observables to overconstrain the system. We note howeve r that the ratio of
11image ampliÔ¨Åcations itself is also dependent on SandŒ≤, and so can also be used to
probe for consistency when more complicated Ô¨Åts to galactic lenses are required.
5. Conclusions
While we have demonstrated here that gravitational lensing provide s in prin-
cipleadirect sensitivity tovariationsin Gover cosmologicaltime, ourresultssuggest
thatto becompetitive with limits on ÀôGatthepresent time, lensing parameters must
be extracted from observations at the level of 10% or better‚Äìa d aunting but not im-
possible task. Statistical measures such as the optical depth do n ot seem suÔ¨Éciently
sensitive to ÀôG/G, the eÔ¨Äects of reasonable changes in Gbeing swamped by larger
uncertainties from our present lack of knowledge of ‚Ñ¶ 0andH0. For individual lens
systems a simpliÔ¨Åed model suggests that it may be possible to see var iations of the
orderÀôG/G‚àº10‚àí11/yr if accurate measures of the angular splitting, ampliÔ¨Åcations,
and perhaps also time delays become available for a system with sourc e and lens at
relatively high redshifts ( zS‚àº2,3 andzL‚àº1). Pessimistically, it is worth noting
that a possible variation in Gis yet one more uncertainty which could limit one‚Äôs
ability to extract H0from measurements of time delays in individual systems. On
the other hand, if H0and ‚Ñ¶ 0are measured reliably by independent means, one‚Äôs
ability to probe for variations in Gwill improve.
Nevertheless, in spite of the limitations of this method, it is worth emp ha-
sizing that it does provide perhaps the only ‚Äòdirect‚Äô probe of variatio ns inGduring
intermediate times between the present epoch, and the nucleosyn thesis era in the
very early universe. We have placed ‚Äòdirect‚Äô in quotation marks beca use as we have
demonstrated, one‚Äôs ability to extract information on ÀôGis intertwined with our
12knowledge (or ignorance) of the proper cosmological model for th e evolution of the
universe during this time. In this regard, we also note that for our a nalysis, we
used as an analytic tool to probe the sensitivity of lensing, a simple Br ans-Dicke
cosmological model, which in fact is already ruled out by other constr aints for the
parameter range which would produce the level of time variation pro bed here. In
this case, Gwould vary as a simple power law with time. We expect our results
would be applicable for any similar, more viable, model. Of course, ther e are other
possibilities, including an oscillatory behaviour of Gwith a cosmologically interest-
ing period (i.e. [Accetta and Steinhardt 1991]). One would need speciÔ¨Å c models to
perform an analysis similar to that performed here, but it may be tha t for such
scenarios, gravitational lensing could provide sensitive limits, by com paring results
obtained from lensing systems at diÔ¨Äerent redshifts.

# üåü Could The Force Of Gravity Change Over Time? Exploring How We Can Test It With Gravitational Lensing

Subtitle: Scientists are using cosmic light-bending phenomena to check if the strength of gravity has evolved throughout the universe‚Äôs history

### üî≠ Why Is The Strength Of Gravity So Important?

Imagine gravity as the universe‚Äôs glue‚Äîholding planets, stars, and galaxies together. But what if this glue isn‚Äôt as constant as we think? Some theories suggest that the gravitational constant, labeled **G**, might change over cosmic time. If true, this could impact our understanding of the universe's history, how galaxies form, and even how the universe itself expands.

Knowing whether **G** has been steady or fluctuating is crucial. It might unravel new physics beyond Einstein‚Äôs General Relativity and shed light on the fundamental workings of the cosmos.

### üß≤ How Can We Detect Changes In G Across Cosmic Time?

Detecting subtle shifts in gravity's strength isn‚Äôt easy. But, astronomers have a clever tool at their disposal: **gravitational lensing**. Think of gravitational lensing as nature‚Äôs giant optical illusion‚Äîmassive objects like galaxies bend light from more distant sources, creating multiple images or brightening backgrounds like a cosmic funhouse mirror.

Here's the trick: the amount of bending depends on **G** and the mass of the lens. By carefully studying these light-bending effects from different galaxies at various distances, scientists can infer whether **G** has been constant or has changed over billions of years.

---

### üîé What Do The Observations Look Like?

To do this, researchers examine phenomena such as:

- **Image splitting**: How far apart are the multiple images of a quasar?
- **Time delays**: How long does light take to travel along different paths?
- **Magnifications**: How bright do the images appear?

All these observables depend on the properties of the lensing galaxy and the universe's overall geometry. By comparing these measurements across different cosmic epochs (distances), scientists can detect tiny variations indicative of a changing **G**.

---

### üí° Theoretical Frameworks and Challenges

Physicists often use models like **Brans-Dicke theory**, which allows **G** to vary with time, as a testing ground. These models modify Einstein's equations to include a scalar field that influences gravity itself.

However, there's a catch: the *mass* of the lensing galaxy‚Äîneeded to determine how much light bends‚Äîis hard to measure independently of **G**. The observables also depend on other uncertain factors like the universe's expansion rate (**Hubble constant**) and matter density (**Œ©0**). This tangled web makes isolating a change in **G** quite challenging.

Furthermore, many current measurements suggest **G** is remarkably steady today, with limits on how fast it could be changing being tiny‚Äîless than about 0.4% per billion years according to other methods like pulsar timing.

---

### üåå Could Future Lensing Studies Detect Changes?

While current techniques face uncertainties, upcoming observations might improve sensitivity enough to detect a relative change of about 10% in **G** over cosmic history. More precise measurements of time delays, image positions, and brightness ratios from distant quasars, especially those at high redshift, could reveal if gravity‚Äôs strength was different when the universe was young.

Detecting such a variation would have profound implications, possibly supporting or ruling out theories involving dynamic "scalar fields" tied to **G**. It could also help clarify whether gravity is truly uniform through the cosmos or subtly oscillates over cosmic epochs.

---

### üåü Why Should We Care?

Understanding whether the gravitational constant has varied is like peering into the universe's deep past, testing the very fabric of physics. It‚Äôs a quest to find out if the rules governing everything we see have been stable or have evolved, revealing deeper layers of the cosmic story.

In the long run, these kinds of studies might not only refine our knowledge of gravity but could point the way toward new physics beyond Einstein‚Äîquesting at the fundamental laws that underpin our universe.
