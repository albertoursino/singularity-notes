    "summary": "The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars\nby intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time\ndelays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the\ngravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in\nprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\nvariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\\dot{G}$\nwhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\none may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\\dot{G}$ today,\nbut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\nto fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\\Omega_0$ from lensing\nobservations.",

(2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW\noscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in\nthe non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The\nnon-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations\ninto sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-\nadiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing\nangles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the\ncorresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a\nnon-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core\ntemperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM\nprediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is\nbroadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY\nSO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by\nintermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs.

Our model is based on counting random\nmultiple impulses inflicted on photon trajectories by the string network\nbetween the time of recombination and today. We construct the temperature\nauto-correlation function and use it to obtain the effective power spectrum\nindex n, the rms-quadrupole-normalized amplitude $Q_{rms-PS}$ and the rms\ntemperature variation smoothed on small angular scales. For the values of the\nscaling solution parameters obtained in Refs.\\cite{bb90},\\cite{as90} we obtain\n$n=1.14 \\pm 0.5$, $Q_{rms-PS}=(4.5\\pm 1.5) G\\mu$ and $({{\\Delta T}\\over\nT})_{rms}=5.5 G\\mu$.

    "summary": "We investigate the sensitivity of individual LIGO/VIRGO-like interferometers and the precision with which they can determine the characteristics of an inspiralling binary system. Since the two interferometers of the LIGO detector share nearly the same orientation, their joint sensitivity is similar to that of a single, more sensitive interferometer. We express our results for a single interferometer of both initial and advanced LIGO design, and also for the LIGO detector in the limit that its two interferometers share exactly the same orientation. We approximate the evolution of a binary system as driven exclusively by leading order quadrupole gravitational radiation. To assess the sensitivity, we calculate the rate at which sources are expected to be observed, the range to which they are observable, and the precision with which characteristic quantities describing the observed binary system can be determined. Assuming a conservative rate density for coalescing neutron star binary systems we expect that the advanced LIGO detector will observe approximately 69~yr${}^{-1}$ with an amplitude SNR greater than 8. Of these, approximately 7~yr${}^{-1}$ will be from binaries at distances greater than 950~Mpc. We explore the sensitivity of these results to a tunable parameter in the interferometer design (the recycling frequency). The optimum choice of the parameter is dependent on the goal of the observations, e.g., maximizing the rate of detections or maximizing the precision of measurement. We determine the optimum parameter values for these two cases.",

We reexamine this model and find that the sterile neutrinos can be either hot, warm, or cold dark matter. Since their only direct coupling is to left-handed or active neutrinos, the most efficient production mechanism is via neutrino oscillations. If the production rate is always less than the expansion rate, then these neutrinos will never be in thermal equilibrium. However, enough of them may be produced so that they provide the missing mass necessary for closure. We consider a single generation of neutrino fields $\\left (\u03bd_L,\\,\u03bd_R\\right )$ with a Dirac mass, $\u03bc$, and a Majorana mass for the right-handed components only, $M$. For $M\\gg \u03bc$ we show that the number density of sterile neutrinos is proportional to $\u03bc^2/M$ so that the energy density today is {\\it independent of} $M$. However $M$ is crucial in determining the large scale structure of the Universe.

In the limit a0 goes to 0 the theory goes to Newtonian dynamics. In the opposite limit the action becomes proportional to 1/a0. Galilei-invariant such theories must be strongly non-local; this is a blessing, as such theories need not suffer from the illnesses that are endemic to higher-derivative theories. We discuss the possibility that such a modified law of motion is an effective theory resulting from the elimination of degrees of freedom pertaining to the universe at large (the near equality a0=cH0 being a trace of that connection). A virial relation for bounded trajectories is derived. Exact solutions are obtained for circular orbits, which pertain to rotation curves of disk galaxies.
