    "title": "Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from lightcone evolution",
    "authors": "Delon Shen, Nickolas Kokron, Emmanuel Schaan",
    "published": "2025-07-23",
    "summary": "Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible\ncorners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright\nforegrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments.\nCross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising\navenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe\nof fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further\nprobe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our\nunderstanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this\ndirect correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible\nbecause smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright\nforegrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of\nforeground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting\nlightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects.\nIndeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the\nlightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode\ncoupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly\nvarying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these\nlightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing\ncross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of\nCOMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this\ncross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB\nlensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of\nLIM with any projected field.",

    "title": "A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts",
    "authors": "Robert Reischke, Steffen Hagstotz",
    "published": "2025-07-23",
    "summary": "Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small\nto intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for\ncontemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution\nare therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under\nastrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and\ndirect probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along\nthe line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of\nthe DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the\nelectron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a\nmodel calibrated to the \\texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we\nforward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this\nmodel to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback\nparameter, $\\log T_\\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement\nof baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of\nno-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\\,\\%$ confidence ($3\\sigma$),\ndepending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback,\nsimilar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and\nkinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline\ncorrelations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate\ncalibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM.\nFurthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary\nimprovements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data,\nparticularly that from low-redshift FRBs.",

    "summary": "Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high\nredshift ($z \\gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive \"V-shaped\" spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their\nevolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is\nchallenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\\it the\nSaguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of\nhigh-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path\ntoward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus\nsurrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1)\nits nuclear spectrum shows a clear \"V-shaped\" SED; and (2) when redshifted to\n$z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking\nan LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended\nhosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically\nselected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins\nreveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution.\nA simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can\nexplain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\\it the Saguaro} is not\nunique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\\lesssim3.5$.\nTaken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a\ndistinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a\nshort-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red\nappearance driven largely by observational biases.",

    "authors": "Gerasimos Kouniatalis, Emmanuel N. Saridakis",
    "published": "2025-07-23",
    "summary": "We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary\nscenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau\nfeatures, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we\nconsider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and\na steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We\nstudy the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged\nperiod of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper\nminimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an\nextra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain\n$r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating\ntemperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of\nthe potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally,\nperforming an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that\nthe considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky\npotential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the\nimproved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",

    "authors": "Masatoshi Hirabayashi",
    "published": "2025-07-23",
    "summary": "In 2029, the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis approaches the Earth within\nsix Earth radii. This opportunity is one of the rarest natural experiments that\nwe can use to better characterize a small body through telescopic observations\nand space missions. Earlier geological investigations consistently suggested\nthat major geological processes might not occur on Apophis during this closest\nencounter, including surface processing and interior deformation. However,\nminor resurfacing may occur, depending on local geological conditions. A\ncritical finding is that the rotational evolution occurs due to the tidal\neffect from the Earth. The present study offers an additional perspective on\nthe rotational evolution, which may vary due to variations in interior\nproperties. Namely, possible deformation processes may change the spin state\nvariation from the rigid body state, even if deformation is not measurable. The\neffort in this work is to explore this issue using a simplified model,\nmotivated by earlier studies by Hirabayashi (2023) and Taylor et al. (2023).\nThe results show that the deformation-driven spin state change may be possible,\ndepending on Young's modulus. If this asteroid's Young's modulus is ~1 MPa or\nhigher, the spin state only deviates a few degrees from the rigid body state\nover one year. However, if it is ~10 kPa or less, the spin state deviation may\nreach a few degrees, even a few days after the closest encounter. Both\ntelescopic observations and space missions can provide strong insights into\nthis phenomenon.",

Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the\nprocesses at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae,\netc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural\none-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on\nanalyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation\nrate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB\nCatalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including\napparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs,\nand the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then\nderive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all\nof which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend.

    "summary": "We present updated results from our near-infrared long-baseline\ninterferometry (LBI) survey to constrain the multiplicity properties of\nintermediate-mass A-type stars within 80 pc. Previous adaptive optics surveys\nof A-type stars are incomplete at separations $<$ 20au. Therefore, a LBI survey\nallows us to explore separations previously unexplored. Our sample consists of\n54 A-type primaries with estimated masses between 1.44-2.93 M$_{\\odot}$ and\nages 10-790 Myr, which we observed with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at\nthe CHARA Array. We use the open source software CANDID to detect two new\ncompanions, seven in total, and we performed a Bayesian demographic analysis to\ncharacterize the companion population. We find the separation distribution\nconsistent with being flat, and we estimate a power-law fit to the mass ratio\ndistribution with index -0.13$^{+0.92}_{-0.95}$ and a companion frequency of\n0.25$^{+0.17}_{-0.11}$ over mass ratios 0.1-1.0 and projected separations\n0.01-27.54au. We find a posterior probability of 0.53 and 0.04 that our results\nare consistent with extrapolations based on previous models of the solar-type\nand B-type companion population, respectively. Our results suggest that the\nclose companion population to A-type stars is comparable to that of solar-types\nand that close companions to B-type stars are potentially more frequent which\nmay be indicative of increased disk fragmentation for stars $\\gtrsim$\n3M$_{\\odot}$.",

In a previous communication, we\npresented a cosmological independent method to constrain the baryon fraction in\nthe IGM ($f_{\\mathrm{IGM}}$), where we derived relevant expressions for the\ndispersion measure ($\\mathrm{DM}$) in terms of luminosity distance, allowing us\nto estimate $f_{\\mathrm{IGM}}$ combining directly measurements of 17\nwell-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe from the Pantheon catalog.

We expand our sample\nby combining 107 well-localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with BAO measurements\nfrom DESI DR2 and SNe observations from DESY5, and the Pantheon+ catalog.
