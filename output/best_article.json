It is a\nstrong source of gamma rays, and its broadband emission has been extensively\nstudied over the years through multi-wavelength observations from various\ntelescopes. Mrk 421 has been a target of observational campaigns conducted by\nthe SST-1M telescopes - two single-mirror small-size Cherenkov telescopes at\nOndrejov Observatory, Prague, Czech Republic. These telescopes operate in mono\nand stereoscopic modes, utilizing the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique\n(IACT) to detect Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays in the 1-300 TeV energy\nrange. We present recent SST-1M observations, data analysis, and the results of\npreliminary physical modeling of Mrk 421's emission mechanisms.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18445v1", "arxiv_id": "2507.18445v1"}
