{"number": 0, "title": "Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from lightcone evolution", "authors": "Delon Shen, Nickolas Kokron, Emmanuel Schaan", "published": "2025-07-23", "summary": "Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible\ncorners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright\nforegrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments.\nCross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising\navenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe\nof fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further\nprobe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our\nunderstanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this\ndirect correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible\nbecause smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright\nforegrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of\nforeground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting\nlightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects.\nIndeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the\nlightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode\ncoupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly\nvarying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these\nlightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing\ncross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of\nCOMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this\ncross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB\nlensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of\nLIM with any projected field.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17752v1"}
