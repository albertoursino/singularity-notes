{"title": "EP250108a/SN2025kg: A Magnetar-powered Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Originating from a Close Helium-star Binary via Isolated Binary Evolution", "authors": "Jin-Ping Zhu, Jian-He Zheng, Bing Zhang", "published": "2025-07-24", "summary": "SN\\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic\nsupernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time\nbroad H$\\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\\em{Letter}}, we propose a\njet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a\nmildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\\sim45^\\circ$ and the early bump of\nSN\\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of\n$\\sim(1-2)\\times10^{52}{\\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\\sim5\\,R_\\odot$.\nTo explain SN\\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection\ninto the $\\sim2.5\\,M_\\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period\n$\\sim1.7\\,{\\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\\sim2\\times10^{15}{\\rm{G}}$ may be\nrequired, implying a rapidly rotating $\\sim4\\,M_\\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the\nprogenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope,\nsupported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind.\nHydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by\nthe late-time broad H$\\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence\ncompanion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed\nnear-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous\nevolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of\nEP250108a/SN\\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by\na main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary\nevolution.", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18544v1", "arxiv_id": "2507.18544v1"}
