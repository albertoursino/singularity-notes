    "title": "Galaxy quenching across the Cosmic Web: disentangling mass and environment with SDSS DR18",
    "authors": "Anindita Nandi, Biswajit Pandey",
    "published": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy\nquenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS\nDR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters\nbased on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density\nfield. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in\nclusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the\nincreasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of\nthe quenched fraction beyond $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\sim 10.6$ across all\nenvironments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven\nquenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this\nthreshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and\nmorphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)\n\\gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in\nclusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway\nwhere massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies,\npotentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also\nincreases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters,\nindicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The\nhigh-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific\nstar formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the\nstellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain\nbluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their\ncluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver\nof galaxy evolution.",

    "title": "Searching for Gravitational Waves with Gaia and its Cross-Correlation with PTA: Absolute vs Relative Astrometry",
    "authors": "Massimo Vaglio, Mikel Falxa, Giorgio Mentasti, Arianna I. Renzini, Adrien Kuntz, Enrico Barausse, Carlo Contaldi, Alberto Sesana",
    "published": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of\nstellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the\nobserver and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these\napparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision\nand scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a\nstochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the\ntwo-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although\nGaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal\nplane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit\nthe precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can\nbe mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which\neffectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute\nthe astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative\nastrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the\nliterature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of\nrelative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis\nshows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is\nlimited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs\nwith large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are\npractically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays\nleads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than\napproximately 10^-7 Hz.",

    "summary": "We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an\nearly-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the\nformation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star\nclusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the\nexistence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8\nkm/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds\nreveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting\ncloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad\nbridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An\nelevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along\nthe filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a\ncollision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD\nmodel of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale,\ndensity, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.",

    "authors": "Jin-Ping Zhu, Jian-He Zheng, Bing Zhang",
    "published": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "SN\\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic\nsupernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time\nbroad H$\\alpha$, and an early bump.

Thus, the\nprogenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope,\nsupported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind.\nHydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by\nthe late-time broad H$\\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence\ncompanion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed\nnear-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous\nevolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of\nEP250108a/SN\\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by\na main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary\nevolution.",

    "summary": "The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent\nframework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and\nmodified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein\naction through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the\nchoice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this\npaper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity\nequation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures\na clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.",

    "summary": "The IceCube Upgrade Camera System is a novel calibration system designed to\ncalibrate the IceCube detector by measuring the optical properties of the\nAntarctic ice. The system comprises nearly 2,000 cameras and illumination LEDs,\nwhich are present on every D-Egg and mDOM, the newly designed optical modules\nfor the IceCube Upgrade. These units, deployed across the IceCube Upgrade\nvolume, will capture transmission and reflection images that can be used to\ncharacterize the optical properties of both the refrozen ice within drill holes\nand the bulk ice between strings. Additionally, the images can aid in\ndetermining the positions of the optical modules the camera systems are mounted\non. To maximize the systems performance, various image analysis methodologies\nhave been explored, ranging from classical maximum likelihood estimation to\nAI-based approaches using neural networks. In this study, we present\npreliminary results on the performance of these methods based on images\ngenerated by a simulation tool developed specifically for this system.",

    "authors": "Gottfried Mann, Frédéric Schuller",
    "published": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "Solar activity can be witnessed in the form of sunspots and active regions,\nwhere the magnetic field is enhanced by up to a factor 1000 as compared to that\nof the quiet Sun. In addition, solar activity manifests itself in terms of\nflares, jets, coronal mass ejections, and production of highly energetic\nparticles. All these processes are governed by the solar magnetic field. Here\nwe study the spatial reach of the influence of the magnetic field of active\nregions on the photosphere and in the solar corona. An active region is\nmodelled by a magnetic dipole located under the photosphere. This simplified\ndescription allows us to study the spatial influence of an active region in the\nsolar atmosphere in a rough but easy way. We find that the area of influence of\nthe magnetic field of an active region on the solar atmosphere increases with,\nboth, the maximum strength of the magnetic field in the active region and the\ndepth of the dipole under the photosphere. For a typical active region, the\nmagnetic field can be neglected for distances beyond ca. 700 Mm on the\nphotosphere and two solar radii in the solar corona.",

    "authors": "Mariane Mangin-Brinet, Angel Bauge, Denis Lacroix",
    "published": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "The Phase-Space Approximation (PSA) approach, originally applied in [Phys.\nRev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino oscillations from a stellar\nobject in the two-flavor limit, is extended here to describe the more realistic\ncase where neutrinos can oscillate between three different flavors. The\napproach is successfully validated against the exact solutions up to eight\nneutrinos. In all cases where the exact solution is feasible, the PSA provides\nexcellent reproduction of the neutrino oscillation dynamics. By replacing the\nfull problem with a set of simple mean-field equations, the PSA offers a\nversatile, predictive, and easily parallelizable approach for tackling\nthree-flavor problems. This enables the simulation of large-scale neutrino\noscillations, as illustrated here with simulations involving up to 300\nneutrinos. Additionally, the method provides insight into the system's\nequilibration properties.",

    "published": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "Polar mesospheric clouds provide clues to physicochemical processes in the\nmesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, the heterogeneous nucleation and\ngrowth processes of water ice under polar mesospheric conditions are poorly\nunderstood, especially at the nanoscale. This study used reflection high energy\nelectron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to analyze\nthe structure of vapor-deposited ice at polar mesospheric temperature (120 K)\nunder vapor pressure conditions. The ice appeared to grow in three steps during\nvapor deposition, being amorphous water for the first 15 nm, then cubic ice up\nto 50 nm, and finally hexagonal ice subsequently. This three step growth\nsuggests that the three observed phases can coexist in polar mesospheric\nclouds, depending on the thickness of water ice. The finding of the three-step\ngrowth also shows that the Ostwald rule of stages can hold for vapor deposited\nice at low temperature.",
