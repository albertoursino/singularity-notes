    "summary": "The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars\nby intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time\ndelays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the\ngravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in\nprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\nvariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\\dot{G}$\nwhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\none may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\\dot{G}$ today,\nbut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\nto fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\\Omega_0$ from lensing\nobservations.",

Some bursts may also be produced through\nneutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,\nan optically thick fireball of size $\\sles\\ 100$ km is initially created, which\nexpands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating.

    "summary": "We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II\nsupernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are\nexplored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which\ntreat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux\ndilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical\nwhen their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type\nII-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty\nintroduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than\n10\\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10\nsupernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN\n1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide\nrange, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing\nthe extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101\nand SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from\nCepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is\nlarger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness\nfluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher\nmethod. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive\na value of $H_0 = 60 \\pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to\nerrors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved\nby applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II\nsupernovae.",

Because the binary's accumulated orbital phase can be measured\nto a fractional accuracy $\\ll 10^{-3}$ and relativistic effects are large, the\nwaveforms will be far more complex, carry more information, and be far harder\nto model theoretically than has been expected. Theorists must begin now to lay\na foundation for extracting the waves' information.",

    "summary": "We show that under certain astrophysical conditions a binary system\nconsisting of two compact objects can be stabilized against indefinite\nshrinking of orbits due to the emission of gravitational radiation. In this\ncase, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss\nof the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its\ngain from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.\nWe claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be\nregarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and\namplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce\nastrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing\nand Doppler effects.",
