    "summary": "The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars\nby intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time\ndelays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the\ngravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in\nprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\nvariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\\dot{G}$\nwhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\none may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\\dot{G}$ today,\nbut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\nto fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\\Omega_0$ from lensing\nobservations.",

(2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW\noscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in\nthe non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The\nnon-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations\ninto sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-\nadiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing\nangles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the\ncorresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a\nnon-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core\ntemperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM\nprediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is\nbroadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY\nSO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by\nintermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs.

Our model is based on counting random\nmultiple impulses inflicted on photon trajectories by the string network\nbetween the time of recombination and today. We construct the temperature\nauto-correlation function and use it to obtain the effective power spectrum\nindex n, the rms-quadrupole-normalized amplitude $Q_{rms-PS}$ and the rms\ntemperature variation smoothed on small angular scales. For the values of the\nscaling solution parameters obtained in Refs.\\cite{bb90},\\cite{as90} we obtain\n$n=1.14 \\pm 0.5$, $Q_{rms-PS}=(4.5\\pm 1.5) G\\mu$ and $({{\\Delta T}\\over\nT})_{rms}=5.5 G\\mu$. Demanding consistency of these results with the COBE data\nleads to $G\\mu=(1.7 \\pm 0.7)\\times 10^{-6}$ (where $\\mu$ is the string mass per\nunit length), in good agreement with direct normalizations of $\\mu$ from\nobservations.",
