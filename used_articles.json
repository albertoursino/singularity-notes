    "summary": "The four observables associated with gravitational lensing of distant quasars\nby intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time\ndelays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the\ngravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in\nprinciple, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the\nvariation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\\dot{G}$\nwhich may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits\none may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\\dot{G}$ today,\nbut unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort\nto fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\\Omega_0$ from lensing\nobservations.",

    "summary": "We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 type II\nsupernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are\nexplored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which\ntreat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux\ndilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical\nwhen their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type\nII-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty\nintroduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than\n10\\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10\nsupernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN\n1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide\nrange, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing\nthe extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101\nand SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from\nCepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is\nlarger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness\nfluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher\nmethod. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive\na value of $H_0 = 60 \\pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to\nerrors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved\nby applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II\nsupernovae.",

    "summary": "We show that under certain astrophysical conditions a binary system\nconsisting of two compact objects can be stabilized against indefinite\nshrinking of orbits due to the emission of gravitational radiation. In this\ncase, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss\nof the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its\ngain from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.\nWe claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be\nregarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and\namplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce\nastrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing\nand Doppler effects.",

For illustration, we show that according to solutions\ninvolving spherically symmetric collapse of pure radiation field, the energy\n$E_\\gamma$ and the observed duration $\\Delta t_o$ of a GRB should satisfy,\n$\\frac{E_\\gamma}{\\Delta t_o} \\leq 4.5 \\times 10^{58} \\ f_\\gamma $ erg\nsec$^{-1}$, $f_\\gamma$ being the fraction ($10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$) of energy\nreleased as gamma rays.

These data are\nbest explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended\nspherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius\nis at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible\norigins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars\nrecoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical\nmodel leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole\nanisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become\nmillisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of\ngamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint.

    "summary": "Constraints on the core temperature (T_c) of the Sun and on neutrino-\noscillation parameters are obtained from the existing solar neutrino data,\nincluding the recent GALLEX and Kamiokande III results. (1) A purely\nastrophysical solution to the solar neutrino problem is strongly disfavored by\nthe data: the best fit in a cooler Sun model requires an 8% reduction in T_c,\nbut the chi-sqaured test rejects this hypothesis at 99.99% C.L., suggesting new\nneutrino physics. (2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW\noscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in\nthe non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The\nnon-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations\ninto sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-\nadiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing\nangles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the\ncorresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a\nnon-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core\ntemperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM\nprediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is\nbroadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY\nSO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by\nintermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs. Superstring-inspired models are consistent with\nall solutions. (4) From the narrowed parameter space, we predict the neutrino\nspectral shape which should be observed in SNO. Throughout the calculation we\nuse the latest Bahcall-Pinsonneault SSM, and include nuclear and astrophysical\nuncertainties in a simplified, but physically transparent way.",

We also\nconsider the large-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background\nradiation coming from these waves. Assuming that the observed quadrupole\nanisotropy comes mostly from gravitational waves (consistent with the\npredictions of a flat spectrum of scalar density perturbations and the measured\ndipole anisotropy) we describe in detail how to derive a value for the scale of\ninflation of $(1.5-5)\\times 10^{16}$GeV, which is at a particularly interesting\nscale for particle physics. This upper limit corresponds to a 95\\% confidence\nlevel upper limit on the scale of inflation assuming only that the quadrupole\nanisotropy from gravitational waves is not cancelled by another source.
