### 🌑 What Is Dark Matter, In Plain Words?

Astronomers can weigh galaxies by how fast stars and gas move. When they do the math, there is a big mismatch: there is far more gravity than the visible stuff can explain. That extra pull comes from dark matter, which does not shine or block light, but clearly has mass.

Think of it like seeing leaves swirl in a breeze. You cannot see the wind, but you know it is there. In the same way, we do not see dark matter directly, but we see what its gravity does to stars, gas, and galaxies.

### ⚖️ Two Big Ideas: WIMPs And MACHOs

Scientists in the early 1990s grouped the main suspects into two easy-to-remember categories.

- WIMPs: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. Imagine tiny, heavy particles that pass through ordinary matter almost without a trace, like ghostly billiard balls that rarely bump anything.
- MACHOs: Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects. These are regular, faint objects hiding in our galaxy’s halo, such as dead stars, brown dwarfs, or even planet-like bodies that do not shine much.

There is also a third idea, the axion: an ultra-light particle that could fill the galaxy like a quiet sea of invisible waves.

### 🔎 How Do You Find Something You Cannot See?

Each idea calls for a different kind of search, and the paper laid out clear, clever strategies.

- MACHOs via microlensing: Space-time acts like a lens. If a dark object passes in front of a background star, its gravity briefly magnifies the star’s light. The sign is a smooth, symmetric brightening that looks the same in different colors. By watching millions of stars night after night, astronomers can count these rare events and even guess the mass of the lenses from how long the brightening lasts.

- WIMPs with direct detection: A WIMP flying through a super-cold crystal might nudge a nucleus and create a tiny burst of energy. Detectors buried deep underground listen for these tiny taps. A key trick is to measure two signals at once, like heat plus electric charge, to tell real nuclear nudges apart from pesky gamma rays. Expected signals are small, so the challenge is to fight background noise.

- WIMPs with indirect detection: Over time, WIMPs could get trapped by the Sun or Earth and pile up in the center. If they bump into each other there, they can annihilate and produce high-energy neutrinos that zoom out. Gigantic detectors in ice, water, or underground rock look for the faint light trails these neutrinos create.

- Axions with radio-like tuning: Axions can turn into microwave photons inside a strong magnetic field. Experiments use a tunable metal cavity like a super-sensitive radio, slowly sweeping through frequencies to catch a whisper of axion signal.

### 🧠 Why WIMPs Felt So Promising

A simple early-universe story boosts the WIMP idea. After the Big Bang, particles constantly collided and annihilated. As the universe expanded and cooled, many dropped out of this traffic. If a particle interacts with about the strength of the weak nuclear force, the amount left over today naturally matches the amount of dark matter we need. This neat coincidence made WIMPs extra appealing and pushed both particle colliders and underground detectors to search the same sweet spot.

### 🚀 What This Roadmap Set In Motion

The review captured a moment when dark matter hunting shifted from talk to action. It argued that, for the first time, experiments had the sensitivity to test the most popular ideas. It also stressed balance: maybe dark matter is made of particles, but maybe some of it is in faint, ordinary objects, so we should check both.

That spirit still guides the field today. The playbook is the same: watch the sky for microlensing, listen underground for tiny nuclear taps, build bigger neutrino telescopes, and keep dialing the axion radio. Whether the answer is a new kind of particle, a population of hidden objects, or something unexpected, these methods give us our best chance to finally meet the invisible majority of our universe.
