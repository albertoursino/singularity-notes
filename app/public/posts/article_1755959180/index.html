Imagine the force that keeps planets orbiting stars and galaxies held together‚Äîthis is gravity, and its strength is determined by a fundamental number known as the gravitational constant, G. For many years, scientists have assumed G to be the same everywhere and at all times, but some theories in physics suggest otherwise. It‚Äôs like wondering if the ‚Äòrule of the game‚Äô of gravity has changed over the universe‚Äôs history.\nIf G isn‚Äôt actually constant and has varied over billions of years, understanding how it has changed could tell us profound things about the very nature of the universe and fundamental physics. This idea traces back to early 20th-century scientist Paul Dirac, who wondered if the laws of physics might evolve over time. Today, some cosmological models even propose that G might oscillate or slowly drift, making it a tantalizing mystery to solve.\nüõ∞Ô∏è How Could We Detect Changes In G? Detecting subtle shifts in G isn‚Äôt easy‚Äîby itself, the number G is notoriously hard to measure precisely in laboratories. But the universe itself offers clues‚Äîparticularly through a phenomenon called gravitational lensing.\nThink of gravitational lensing as nature‚Äôs giant cosmic magnifying glass. When a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies lies between us and a distant quasar (a bright galaxy core), its gravity bends the light, creating multiple images or rings. The detailed properties of these lensed images depend on G, the masses involved, and the distances between objects.\nNow, if G were different in the past, the way light bends back then would vary. By comparing observations of lensing phenomena at various redshifts (which correspond to different times in cosmic history), we might detect tiny deviations that point to changes in the strength of gravity over billions of years.\nüåå What Do The Models Say? Scientists use theoretical models, especially those based on an extended version of Einstein‚Äôs general relativity called Brans-Dicke theory, to explore how G might vary with time. These models relate how the universe expands and how gravity behaves, showing that a changing G would subtly alter the distances and timings involved in gravitational lensing.\nFor example, if G has decreased over time, light passing near a galaxy billions of years ago would have been bent slightly differently compared to today. The models predict that these differences, although tiny, could be detectable because they influence several observable quantities:\nImage separation: How far apart multiple images appear. Time delays: The difference in arrival times of light arriving along different paths. Lensing probabilities: How often we see such lensed systems. Remarkably, the research suggests that with precise enough measurements, we could indeed set limits on how much G has changed, approaching sensitivities comparable to or better than current laboratory and solar system measurements.\nü§î Why Is This Important? Understanding whether G has changed over cosmic time isn‚Äôt just an abstract exercise; it‚Äôs fundamental to physics and cosmology. If G varies, it could impact everything from the formation and evolution of galaxies to the very equations that describe our universe.\nProbing G‚Äôs stability helps test theories beyond Einstein‚Äôs, including those aiming to unify gravity with quantum physics. It might also provide key insights into dark energy, dark matter, and other cosmic mysteries. Essentially, by studying the universe‚Äôs grandest scales, scientists are trying to answer whether the ‚Äòrules‚Äô governing gravity are universal and unchanging, or if they have evolved since the dawn of time.\nSource Paper‚Äôs Authors: Lawrence Krauss, Martin White\nPDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9204002v1\n","wordCount":"583","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-08-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-08-23T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Powered by OpenAI (gpt-4.1-nano)"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://albertoursino.github.io/singularity-notes/posts/article_1755959180/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Singularity Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://albertoursino.github.io/singularity-notes/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://albertoursino.github.io/singularity-notes/ accesskey=h title="Singularity Notes (Alt + H)">Singularity Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
